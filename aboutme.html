            <p> My name is Selena Brosious. I am a twenty-two years old from Burrillville Rhode Island. For most people that don't know, Burrillville is a quiet town located in the Northern part of Rhode Island bordering both Massachusetts and Connecticut. I am currently in my last year at the University of Rhode Island. I plan on graduating this upcoming Spring semester with a degree in Elementary Education and a minor Psychology and a minor in Sociology. During my free time I relaxing and spending time with my friends. Some new hobbies I have picked up within this past year are snowboarding, golfing, and recently just learned how to ride a Harley!
